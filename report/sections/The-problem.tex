The project aimed to achieve a clustering among a given set of genes,
basing on their expression level. I was provided with a dataset of 72
patients, each of which is affected either by \emph{Acute Lymphoblastic
Leukemia} or by \emph{Acute Myeloid Leukemia}. Each record of the given
dataset reports the expression levels for 5147 genes.

The expression level of a gene can used to discriminate the two forms of
leukemia: basing on how the dataset is partitioned (more details on this
later) genes can be ranked according to their precision in splitting the
dataset.

My final objective was the clustering hierarchically the genes having the
best splitting performances, thus the available data have been elaborated
in two phases:
\begin{itemize}
\item   The recognition of the best splitting threshold for each gene;
\end{itemize}
