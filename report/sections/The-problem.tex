    \subsubsection{Genes ranking}

        The \FileName{genes\_rank} program analyzes the dataset file with
        a \emph{supervised-learning} technique:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item   It identifies, for each gene, the best threshold to be
                used for classification purposes;
        \item   It orders the genes according to their effectiveness in
                categorization;
        \item   It produces as output a set of vectors, each of which
                corresponds to a patient
        \end{itemize}
